        Identify System language by checking the environment variables

        Upon successful execution, the 5 character locale result can be looked up to
        correlate the language and territory. Environment query commands are likely
        to run with a pattern match command e.g. `env | grep LANG`

        Note: `env` and `printenv` will usually provide the same results. `set` is
        also used as a builtin command that does not generate syscall telemetry but
        does provide a list of the environment variables.
